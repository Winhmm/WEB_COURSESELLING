        question: "It is observed that in many countries not enough students are choosing to study science subjects. What are the causes? And what will be the effects on society?",
        answer: `
            <p>In several parts of the world, there is a shortage of science students. This essay discusses reasons why not enough students are choosing to study science subjects and analyzes a range of detrimental consequences for society. </p>
            <p>There are several reasons that can be attributed to the declining interest in science subjects. The primary reason is that these subjects are challenging and demanding. Many students are intimidated by the complexity of theories and formulas, which require strong logical thinking and a great deal of effort. As a result, these students tend to avoid science courses and choose other subjects that they find more enjoyable and less stressful. The second reason is that science-related fields are believed to offer a limited range of career options. In comparison with other areas such as business and marketing, science careers are sometimes seen as less attractive in terms of income and job opportunities. Therefore, many students choose other majors that they believe can provide a better financial foundation and more stable employment in the future.</p>
            <p>The negative impacts brought about by this trend on society are becoming evident. A declining number of science students might lead to a lack of labor for important industries such as healthcare, engineering, and technology. This shortage of skilled workers can slow down scientific research and technological innovation, which are essential for the country’s long-term development. Consequently, the overall economic growth of a nation may be negatively affected, causing it to lag behind other countries.</p>
            <p>In conclusion, the shortage of students choosing science subjects is caused by the challenging nature of these subjects and their limited career prospects. This problem might bring about serious implications in terms of technological development and scientific literacy, which could hinder progress in all socio-economic aspects.</p>
